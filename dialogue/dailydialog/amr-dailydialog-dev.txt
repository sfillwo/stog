I had trouble booking the photographer  ,  and then Michael was sick for three weeks  ,  so I couldn't include him in the photos  ,  and the design team lost all the files  ,  so I had to re-do the pictures  .

(d / dummy)

# ::snt I don't think we'll be able to pay the price  .  To have this business concluded  ,  you need to lower your price at least by 3  %   . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 49.6
# ::snt I'm afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 49.7
# ::snt Don't you agree with me that in the long run  ,  moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit  ? 
(d / dummy)

(d / dummy)

# ::id 54.4
# ::snt Wow  ,  thank you for telling me these  .  Do you mind telling me something else  ,  like attendance record  ,  holiday  ,  and how to ask for leave  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 54.5
# ::snt All new members are likely to ask the same questions  .  Haha  .  I can understand that  .  Every month you have three days off  ,  besides the weekends and some important holidays  .  After you've been here for a year  ,  you qualify for a one-week vacation  .  The leave less than a half-day should predict for an hour  ,  and more than a half-day should predict three days  .

# ::id 55.5
# ::snt That's really surprising  .  I always thought they are well matched  .  What about the kids  ?  Who get custody  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 55.6
# ::snt Masha  ,  it seems quiet and makable  ,  no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 55.7
# ::snt That's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about  .  Well  ,  I still can't believe it  ,  Masha and Hero  ,  the perfect couple  .  When would they divorce be final  ?

# ::snt No  ,  I'm not sure  .  But I usually take out my wallet when I sit down . It's uncomfortable to sit on it  .  So I usually put it next to me on the table  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 57.15
# ::snt Maybe you lost it before you came here  .  Or maybe you left it at home  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 57.16
# ::snt I don't think it's at home  .  I think I had it when I left the house . But what should I do  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 57.17
# ::snt Well  ,  the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home . Then  ,  if it isn't  ,  you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards  .  Next  ,  you need to replace whatever you lost  ,  your driver's license  ,  things like that  .

(d / dummy)

# ::id 76.8
# ::snt What do you mean  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 76.9
# ::snt We're stranded here  ,  Tom  .  We may be here a long time . We need to conserve the gas in the car  .  The car's energy is what will keep us warm  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 76.10
# ::snt I have plenty of gas  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 76.11
# ::snt Yes  ,  but the gas and the battery both have to stay working . We can't just let the car run and run . If we do  ,  it will die soon  .  Then we'll freeze  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 76.12
# ::snt So what can we do  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 76.13
# ::snt Turn the lights off . Then  ,  run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . That will conserve the heat as long as possible  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::snt Alright  .  That's a good idea  . 
(d / dummy)

(d / dummy)

# ::id 81.10
# ::snt Okay  ,  I think that will be all for me today  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 82.0
# ::snt I think you know already that I want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 82.1
# ::snt Yes  ,  Mr  .  Bergeron  .  You mentioned that in your letter  .  To tell you the truth  ,  your proposal surprised us  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 82.2
# ::snt Is that so  ?  Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person  ,  so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration  .  Our firm specializes in this line of business  .  We have six sales representatives  ,  who are on the road all the time  ,  covering the whole of the European market  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 82.3
# ::snt Do you sell direct to shops  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 82.4
# ::snt Yes  ,  we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts  .  We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct  ,  without any middlemen  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 82.5
# ::snt Do you keep a stock of these things  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 82.6
# ::snt In some cases  ,  such as the wristwatches  ,  which always have a steady market  ,  we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents  .  Generally  ,  however  ,  we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply  .  We are paid for our service  ,  of course  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 82.7
# ::snt That is  ,  your commission  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 82.8
# ::snt Yes  ,  our commission is very reasonable  .  We usually get a 10  %  commission of the amount on every deal  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 82.9
# ::snt Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5  %  commission  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 82.10
# ::snt The European market is not familiar with your products  .  You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries  .  At the beginning of our campaign  ,  there is sales resistance to overcome  ,  we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs  .  A 10  %  commission will not leave us much  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 82.11

(d / dummy)

(d / dummy)

# ::id 82.14
# ::snt Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 82.15
# ::snt Mr  .  Bergeron  ,  you leave us no alternative  .  We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover  .  Besides our price is worked out according to the costing  .  A 10  %  commission means an increase in our price  .  We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 82.16
# ::snt Oh  ,  that's just too bad  .  I intended to make great efforts in selling your products  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 82.17
# ::snt Well  ,  we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement  .  To start the ball rolling  ,  we will provide you with price lists  ,  catalogues and some samples  .

(d / dummy)

# ::id 82.21
# ::snt Very good  .  We will discuss the matter again at the next Fair  . 
(d / dummy)

(d / dummy)

# ::id 86.0
# ::snt We have been over this a hundred times  !  We are not getting a pet  !

(d / dummy)

# ::id 205.4
# ::snt Thank you  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 205.5
# ::snt Now Mr  .  Tylor's on the line  .  Go ahead  ,  please  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 205.6
# ::snt You are so kind  ,  you helped me a lot  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 205.7
# ::snt You are welcome  .  Bye  ! 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 206.0
# ::snt Good afternoon  ,  Lexington Software  .  Angelina Dawson  ,  how can I help  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 206.1
# ::snt Hello  ,  this is Quinn from IBA  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 206.2
# ::snt Ah  ,  hello Quinn  .  Oh dear  ,  you are calling to tell me there is a problem  ,  aren't you  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 206.3
# ::snt I'm afraid so  ,  yes  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 206.4
# ::snt Hmm  .  .  .  well  ,  it was my first attempt  !  Is it a very big mistake  ,  or can we just alter it  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 206.5
# ::snt Unfortunately it's rather a big mistake  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 206.6
# ::snt What do you recommend we do  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 206.7
# ::snt I would recommend we scrap this one and you bring in another set as soon as possible  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 206.8
# ::snt I trust your judgement  .  Thank you  ,  Quinn  .  I'll be back tomorrow with a new set  .  Bye for now  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 207.0
# ::snt Oh  !   !   !  I have a horrible toothache  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 207.1
# ::snt You should go to the dentist  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 207.2
# ::snt I hate dentists  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 207.3
# ::snt Well  ,  suffer then  .  If you have a toothache  ,  you have to go to the dentist  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 207.4
# ::snt It always hurts  .  I hate going  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 207.5
# ::snt Stop being such a baby  .  If it really hurts that much  ,  just let them knock you out  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 207.6
# ::snt O  .  K  .   ,  O  .  K  .   ,  I'll go  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 207.7
# ::snt Good  .  You'll feel better after you do  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 208.0
# ::snt Hi  ,  I would like to purchase a one way ticket to Brussels  ,  please  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 208.1
# ::snt Certainly sir  ,  this is our train schedule  .  We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 208.2
# ::snt How long does it take to get there  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 208.3
# ::snt About twelve hours  .  We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train  .  If you'd like  ,  you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 208.4
# ::snt Yeah  ,  I think that is the best option  .  Do you serve food on the train  ?  Twelve hours is such a long time  ! 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 208.5
# ::snt Yes  ,  of course  .  There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times  .  We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 208.6
# ::snt Great  !  I'll take it  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 208.7
# ::snt Here you are sir  .  Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot  .  Remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train  ! 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 208.8
# ::snt I understand  .  Thank you very much  ! 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 208.9
# ::snt Have a great trip  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 209.0
# ::snt I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 209.1
# ::snt A trip to the beach would be fun  .  How is the weather going to be  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 209.2
# ::snt The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 209.3
# ::snt So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 209.4
# ::snt It sounds like it will be  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 209.5
# ::snt I really hope it doesn't get cold  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 209.6
# ::snt That would ruin things  ,  I want to go so badly  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 209.7
# ::snt The weather in California is unpredictable  ,  so you never know  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 209.8
# ::snt That is true  .  The weather is constantly changing  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 209.9
# ::snt It would be nice if the weather would never change  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 209.10
# ::snt That would be great  ,  then we could plan things sooner  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 209.11
# ::snt True  .  Predictable weather would make life easier  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 210.0
# ::snt Some companies use to ban dating among employees  ,  but now they have realized it is something in avertable  .  People spend so much time at work  .  It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 210.1
# ::snt If we think positively  ,  office love can be beneficial to company  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 210.2
# ::snt Beneficial  ?  I don't think so  .  If two employees get married  ,  they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon  ,  or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies  .  If they break up  ,  the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable  .  By any means  ,  the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 210.3
# ::snt But if two employees are in love  ,  they will be happy  .  Happy people are more productive  .  If they develop an intimate relation with each other  ,  they are willing to share knowledge and experience  .  It can help to improve work efficiency  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 210.4
# ::snt I doubt that  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 211.0
# ::snt Do you eat a lot of healthy food  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 211.1
# ::snt Compared with healthy food  ,  unhealthy food just tastes so much better  .  And anyway  ,  I believe if you live a low stress Life and are active  ,  you can get away with eating whatever you like  .  It's all in the mind  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 211.2
# ::snt You have the point  .  I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume  .  Some good things you should try are cranberry juice  ,  wild rice and yoghurt  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 211.3
# ::snt What's special about these things  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 211.4
# ::snt Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic  .  Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice  .  Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein  ,  vitamins and is also acidic  .  People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day  ,  your guts will be much more settled  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 211.5
# ::snt Thanks  .  I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 212.0
# ::snt I've been so tired recently  .  I've been trying  ,  but I don't think I'm up to this job  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 212.1
# ::snt You need to take a break  ,  maybe a vacation  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 212.2
# ::snt Oh  ,  yes  ,  indeed  .  I've run out of steam  .  To be honest  ,  I want to be in a different environment  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 212.3
# ::snt Is that so  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 212.4
# ::snt Yes  ,  I don't want to be stuck in a rut  .  I want to move on  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 212.5
# ::snt Have you decided  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 212.6
# ::snt Yes  .  I want to get a better job  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 212.7
# ::snt Could you tell me why you want to quit  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 212.8
# ::snt I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 212.9
# ::snt Oh  ,  that's terrible  .  Do you want to get a higher salary in our company  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 212.10
# ::snt I'm afraid not  .  I've promised my girlfriend  .  We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 212.11
# ::snt OK  ,  I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you  .  However  ,  I think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 212.12
# ::snt Thank you so much for your advice  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 212.13
# ::snt And every best wish for your new job  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 212.14
# ::snt Thank you  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 213.0
# ::snt The train is leaving  .  Hurry up  !  Which car are we in  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 213.1
# ::snt Let me see  .  Oh  ,  No  .  11  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 213.2
# ::snt Here we are  ,  Car 11  .  Let's get in  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 213.3
# ::snt Seats No  .  20 and 21  .  It's nice that we'Ve got a window seat  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 213.4
# ::snt Let's put our suitcases on the rack  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 213.5
# ::snt Oh  ,  the baggage rack is full  .  Put them under the seat for the time being  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 213.6
# ::snt All right  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 214.0
# ::snt So  ,  how should we get to the theatre  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 214.1
# ::snt Let's take the bus  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 214.2
# ::snt I hate the bus system in London  !  The bus drivers are rude  ,  the buses are never on time  ,  and there are few people around who can help you  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 214.3
# ::snt It's not that bad  .  You probably just had a bad experience once  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 214.4
# ::snt It wasn't just once  .  Every single time I take the bus  ,  something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 214.5
# ::snt We could take the subway  ,  but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 214.6
# ::snt Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare  ,  too  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 214.7
# ::snt If we don't hurry up  ,  we'll miss the show  .  Should we take the bus  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 214.8
# ::snt We're already late  ,  so I think we had better take a taxi  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 214.9
# ::snt I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours  .  Let's just take the bus  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 214.10
# ::snt Fine  .  Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 214.11
# ::snt It looks like it should be here in just a few minutes  .  don't worry  .  Nothing bad will happen  .  I'll even buy your ticket for you  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 214.12
# ::snt Thanks  ,  that was nice of you  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 214.13
# ::snt See  ,  now something good has happened to you on a bus trip  ! 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 215.0
# ::snt Let's go over this plan again  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 215.1
# ::snt From Vancouver  ,  we bike along the border all the way to Winnipeg  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 215.2
# ::snt And that is mostly flat  ,  right  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 215.3
# ::snt Relatively  ,  once we're out of Alberta  ,  anyway  .  Then it's hills again in Aitoba  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 215.4
# ::snt And from Winnipeg we go around the lakes through Toronto  ,  right  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 215.5
# ::snt That's right  .  And up in to Quebec  .  And that's where we stop  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 215.6
# ::snt It doesn't sound like that much when we go over the plan but that's a long  ,  long ride  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 215.7
# ::snt Are you ready for the cross country of a lifetime  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 216.0
# ::snt Good morning  ,  sir  .  What can I do for you  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 216.1
# ::snt I'm Bill  .  I'm in Room 908  .  Can you change the room for me  ?  It's too noisy  .  My wife was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made  .  She said it was too much for her  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 216.2
# ::snt I'm awfully sorry  ,  sir  .  I do apologize  .  Room 908 is at the end of the corridor  .  It's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when all is quiet  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 216.3
# ::snt Anyhow  ,  I'd like to change our room  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 216.4
# ::snt No problem  ,  sir  .  We'll manage it  ,  but we don't have any spare room today  .  Could you wait till tomorrow  ?  The American People-to-people Education Delegation will be leaving tomorrow morning  .  There'll be some rooms for you to choose from  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 216.5
# ::snt All right  .  I hope we'll be able to enjoy our stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 216.6
# ::snt Be sure  .  I'll make a note of that  .  Everything will be taken care of  .  And if there is anything more you need  ,  please let us know  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 217.0
# ::snt It's time for bed  .

# ::snt I'm not going to be able to fall asleep  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 217.4
# ::snt Why don't you try counting sheep  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 217.5
# ::snt I've tried that before  .  It really doesn't work  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 217.6
# ::snt That's beside the point  ,  you still need to go to bed  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 217.7
# ::snt Why can't I just stay up until I fall asleep  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 217.8
# ::snt If I let you do that  ,  then you're just going to be up all night  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 217.9
# ::snt I promise I'll go to sleep soon  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 217.10
# ::snt No  ,  you're going to sleep now  ,  so good night  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::snt See you in the morning  . 
(d / dummy)

(d / dummy)

# ::id 218.1

(d / dummy)

# ::id 218.2
# ::snt I think I can work well under pressure  ,  if necessary  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 218.3
# ::snt How would you deal with those who are not easy to get along with  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 218.4
# ::snt I will just be sincere and friendly to others  ,  and I believe they will treat me the same way  . 
(d / dummy)

(d / dummy)

# ::snt Nice meeting you  ,  too  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 221.0
# ::snt I made my little brother cry  .

# ::id 221.1
# ::snt Shame on you  !

(d / dummy)

# ::id 222.1
# ::snt Of course  .  Here is our thickening mascara  .  We also have mascara designed to lengthen the eyelashes  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 222.2
# ::snt Alright  .  And I want to consider your eye shadow too  .  Do you have a color chart can look at  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 222.3
# ::snt We have a very wide selection of colors  .  And our eye shadow is specially designed to moisturize the skin  .  So it is very gentle on your eyelids  .  Would you like to sample some  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 222.4
# ::snt Oh  ,  sure I will need to clean off my own eye shadow first  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::snt So you have to bring your baggage to the transfer check-in area  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 223.4
# ::snt Yes . It's quite troublesome  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 223.5
# ::snt Why not go and find a porter  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 224.0
# ::snt Billy  ,  you don't look too well  .  Maybe you should take the day off school  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::snt Hi  ,  Rita  ,  I'm just looking for a pair of shoes  .  I won't be here for long  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 237.2
# ::snt Why not  ?  When I go shoe shopping  ,  I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 237.3
# ::snt That's my problem  .  I don't have a lot of options  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 237.4
# ::snt What do you mean  ?  This is a big store  ,  isn't it  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 237.5
# ::snt Yes  ,  but I have unusually big feet  .  That wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide  ,  and only a few brands sell shoes that I can fit into  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 237.6
# ::snt So how do you usually go about buying shoes  ,  then  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 237.7

(d / dummy)

# ::id 237.8
# ::snt Well  ,  you're in the right store  .  If they don't have it  ,  no one will  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 237.9
# ::snt After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me  .  I prefer white  ,  so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size  .  Since I'm usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications  ,  it makes it a very easy choice  . 
(d / dummy)

(d / dummy)

(d / dummy)

# ::snt The bathroom looks lovely  .  Did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 290.1
# ::snt I did it myself  .  I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement  .  Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed  .  I'm sure I saved a lot of money by doing it myself and it was fun too  .  I learnt a lot by doing it myself  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 290.2
# ::snt So  ,  let's see  .  You have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls  .  You'Ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries  .  The bath  ,  shower  ,  and washbasin are the same as before  ,  aren't they  ? 
(d / dummy)

(d / dummy)

# ::id 290.4
# ::snt How long did it take you to do the tiling  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 290.5
# ::snt As I hadn't done it before  ,  I had to keep referring to income 3ation I got from the internet  .  Doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening  .  Then I spent a few hours replacing the cracked wall tiles  .  Putting the cupboard up took about an hour  ,  so it took me two days altogether  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 290.6
# ::snt I think you'Ve done a very good job  .  As least as good as a professional would do  .  Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 290.7
# ::snt You'll be lucky  !  However  ,  I'll print out the income 3ation I got from the internet and you can do it yourself  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 291.0
# ::snt I'd like to see that pen  ,  please  .

# ::id 291.6
# ::snt It's very smooth  .  I'll take it  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 291.7
# ::snt Cash or charge  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 291.8
# ::snt Charge  ,  please  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 292.0
# ::snt I'Ve come to hear about your offer for bristles  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 292.1
# ::snt We have the offer ready for you  .  Let me see  .  .  .  here it is  .  100 cases Houston Bristles  ,  57 mm  ,  at 10 pounds sterling per kilogram  ,  C  .  I  .  F European Main Ports  ,  for shipment in June 2001  .  The offer is valid for five days  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 292.2
# ::snt Why  ,  your price has soared  .  It's almost 25  %  higher than last year's  .  It would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 292.3
# ::snt I'm a little surprised to hear you say that  .  You know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months  .  The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 292.4
# ::snt I'm afraid I can't agree with you there  .  I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we'Ve received from other sources  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 292.5
# ::snt But you must take the quality into consideration  .  Everyone in the trade knows that US's bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 292.6
# ::snt I agree that yours are of better quality  .  But there's competition from synthetic products  ,  too  .  You can't very well ignore that  .  Prices for synthetic bristles haven't changed much over the years  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 292.7
# ::snt There's practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses  .  That's why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones  .  To be frank with you  ,  if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us  ,  we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 292.8
# ::snt Well  ,  we'll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price  .  But I'll have to try  ,  I suppose  .

I loved many things about my former job  ,  and I left with amiable feelings on both sides  .  I was just ready for something new  .

(d / dummy)

# ::id 351.1

# ::snt I know  ,  but I think it's not really appropriate for young children  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 351.6
# ::snt I think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 351.7
# ::snt all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 351.8
# ::snt perhaps you're right  ,   ,  though  .  Maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 351.9
# ::snt I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults  ,  but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 351.10
# ::snt that's a good point  .  I think I was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that I didn't think about how children might understand the ad  .

Here alone  ,  the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity  .

(d / dummy)

# ::id 542.3

# ::id 582.5
# ::snt It's an Egyptian carpet  .  The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude  .  Seeing what gift was  ,  I was really uncomfortable  .

# ::id 636.13
# ::snt But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 636.14
# ::snt He said he had to get rid of them  .  They were stolen  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 636.15
# ::snt Aha  !  Now I understand . You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk . So  ,  what I think is  ,  you deserve to get cheated  ! 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 636.16
# ::snt C'mon  ,  don't blame me  !  I thought it was a new camera  .  We could use it . We were even thinking about buying a camera  .  I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 636.17
# ::snt That's no problem . He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap  .  That's easy . And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from . Maybe his friend works in an electronics store  .  They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around . So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you . Twenty dollars a brick  .  That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks  .

(d / dummy)

# ::id 638.7
# ::snt How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 638.8
# ::snt I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 638.9

(d / dummy)

(d / dummy)

(d / dummy)

(d / dummy)

(d / dummy)

# ::id 647.15
# ::snt The way it is now  ,  the staff from all four branches get together once a week . We meet for one hour  .  But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation  .

(d / dummy)

# ::id 647.23

# ::id 647.24
# ::snt You mean you want to run the meetings  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 647.25
# ::snt No  ,  not really run them  .  But I could help organize them  .  I could discuss meeting topics with you  ,  and then prepare a schedule for each meeting  .  I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting . This way the meetings would become more focused  ,  and people would prepare better  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 647.26
# ::snt Hmm  .  But we would meet every two weeks  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 647.27
# ::snt I really think it would work . The meetings could be longer  ,  and better organized  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 647.28
# ::snt I am not against the idea  ,  Arnold . It may really be more efficient  ,  as you say  .  I'll tell you what we can do . Why don't we try your proposal for a month  ,  and see how it works  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 647.29
# ::snt Excellent  .  I would be happy to get started on it  . 
(d / dummy)

(d / dummy)

# ::id 864.2
# ::snt Well  ,  I am all ears  .  Maybe they are helpful  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 864.3
# ::snt Firstly  ,  you must always show your best to the interviewer  .  And secondly  ,  try to avoid spamming through e-mails  ,  because this will make the reader go crazy  .  The last but not the least  ,  there is no substitute for pounding the pavement in such a digital age  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 864.4

# ::id 866.8
# ::snt OK  .  I'll take the blue one  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 867.0
# ::snt Hello  ,  again  .  Did you discuss everything with your colleagues  ?

# ::id 867.1
# ::snt Yes  ,  yes  .  It seems that everything is settled  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 867.2
# ::snt Have you decided how you would like the salaries paid  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 867.3
# ::snt We have discussed it and decided that at the moment we would like the salaries to be paid into the employees's accounts  ,  whether they are currently with this bank or not  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 867.4
# ::snt That's not a problem  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 867.5
# ::snt Of course  ,  if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank  ,  or open new accounts with you  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 867.6
# ::snt Thank you very much  .  We always welcome new customers  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 868.0
# ::snt I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 868.1
# ::snt We should plan to move out of here before July  .  I'm tired of living in apartments  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 868.2
# ::snt I know  ,  dear  .  I am too  .  But we've just been too busy to look for a house  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 868.3
# ::snt We need to find a good realtor  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 868.4
# ::snt Not necessarily  .  If we use a realtor to find a house  ,  it will be more expensive  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 868.5
# ::snt What do you mean  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 868.6
# ::snt Realtors always get a commission . If the realtor helps us find something  ,  we have to pay him  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 868.7
# ::snt But doesn't a realtor help with the contract  ?  I thought they take care of all the legal troubles  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 868.8
# ::snt Yes  ,  that's often true  .  But you have to pay them  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 868.9
# ::snt I still think we should have a realtor . We're new in this country  .  We don't know all the laws of buying a house . And also  ,  the realtor will inspect the house . He can tell us if the house has
(d / dummy)

# ::id 868.10
# ::snt Of course we need a home inspector . But we can hire an inspector on our own . And as for the legal problems  ,  I have friends  .  They can help us  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 868.11
# ::snt So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 868.12
# ::snt It takes a little more time  .  We have to check the ads in the paper . Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads . Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 868.13
# ::snt And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 868.14
# ::snt Sometimes they do  ,  sometimes they don't  .  It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 868.15
# ::snt Why  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 868.16
# ::snt Because if the seller has a realtor  ,  their price will be higher . He will have to pay a commission to the realtor  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 868.17
# ::snt Hmm  .  It all sounds very complicated  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 868.18
# ::snt It is  .  But buying a house is very important  .  So it takes time . That's why we haven't done it yet  .  It's very troublesome  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 868.19
# ::snt I want to look in the papers today  .  Maybe we can see something we like  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 868.20

# ::snt So that concludes the introduction  .  Now let's move to the first part of my talk  ,  which is about 2006 fiscal year marketing plan  .  So first  ,  right off the bat  ,  When looking at the marketing plan  ,  tell me some of the goals that we had set this year to begin with  .  .  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 884.1
# ::snt We wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also  ,  in line with that goal  ,  redo our image  .  .  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 884.2
# ::snt That's correct  .  If you remember  ,  we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets  .  Now  ,  when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals  ,  there are three things to consider  .  First  ,  the original condition of the market  ,  second  ,  our marketing numbers from the previous year  ,  and third  ,  our final sales figures for this year  .  Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts  .  If you look at the overhead  ,  you'll see a graph  .  .  .  The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005  ,  the red line is the sales in 2006  .  .  .  As you can see  ,  our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with  ,  but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year  .  On the other hand  ,  you can see this year's sales took off like a rocket  .
