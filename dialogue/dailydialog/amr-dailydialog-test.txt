(d / dummy)

# ::id 45.3

(d / dummy)

# ::id 46.6
# ::snt Yes  ,  I have  .  But the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious  .  The fish is not well-done and too salty  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 46.7
# ::snt That's the case  .  I think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 46.8
# ::snt I have the same idea as yours  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 46.9
# ::snt It's OK  .  Please have a taste of it  .

# ::id 50.2
# ::snt What about a draft at 120 days sight  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 50.3
# ::snt All right  .  But we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 50.4
# ::snt A bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports  .  You can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due  .

(d / dummy)

# ::id 54.8
# ::snt Wait  .  Let me tell the lady what we would like to order in front of the seafood fridge first  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 54.9
# ::snt OK  .  I will wait for you inside the restaurant
(d / dummy)

# ::id 54.10

(d / dummy)

(d / dummy)

# ::snt By the way  ,  what's the time  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 55.6
# ::snt You can see the time on the meter  .  I have radio time  ,  you know  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 55.7
# ::snt It's a quarter to 12  .  Could you please drive a little faster  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 55.8
# ::snt Certainly  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 56.0
# ::snt You're made a good choice  .  This china tea set is unusual  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 56.1
# ::snt Where was it from  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 56.2
# ::snt It was made in Jingdezhen  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 56.3
# ::snt Jingdezhen  ?  Isn't it called'the capital of porcelain' ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 56.4
# ::snt You are right  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 56.5
# ::snt This is the very thing I've been dreaming of  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 56.6
# ::snt It is the best quality porcelain-the famous egg-shell China  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 56.7
# ::snt It must be most precious  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 56.8
# ::snt But it is really worth the price  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 57.0
# ::snt Hello  ,  Miao Li  ,  Where are you going  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 57.1

(d / dummy)

# ::id 58.0
# ::snt I have a cell phone in my car  .  Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side . Why don't you get it for me  ,  and then I can call the police  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 58.1
# ::snt Alright  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 58.3

(d / dummy)

# ::id 58.4
# ::snt Damn it  !  I'm injured here  .  We could wait all day for the police  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 58.5
# ::snt Well  ,  you'll just have to wait  .  I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive  .  I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone  .  Don't worry  .  You'll get to the hospital in time  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 58.6
# ::snt It really hurts  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 58.7
# ::snt Yes  ,  maybe it does . But if you're going to drive like you did just now  ,  you will have to get used to a little physical pain  .  You know what I mean  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 58.8
# ::snt To hell with you  .  The accident was your fault  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 58.9
# ::snt I'm afraid it wasn't  .  And when the police get here  ,  you will also see that it wasn't  .  But enough of this bickering  .  I'm going to go find a phone . Don't move that arm while I'm gone  .  Alright  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 58.10
# ::snt To hell with you  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 59.0

(d / dummy)

# ::id 60.1

# ::id 60.2
# ::snt I tell you what  ,  2 : 00 is not available for me  ,  but you can get started and I'll come by at around 3 : 00
(d / dummy)

# ::id 61.1
# ::snt French dressing  ,  please  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 61.2
# ::snt I beg your pardon  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 61.3
# ::snt Oh  ,  French dressing  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 61.4
# ::snt Sorry  ,  it's not available now . Anything else  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 61.5
# ::snt We still prefer French dressing  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 62.0
# ::snt Could I have some fish  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 62.1
# ::snt Certainly  .  And what vegetables would you like  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 62.2
# ::snt Oh  ,  spinach  ,  I think  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 62.3
# ::snt Fine  ,  And what about something to drink  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 62.4
# ::snt Just a beer  ,  please  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 62.5
# ::snt Good  .  Thank you . sir  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 62.6
# ::snt Would you like to have some more beer  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 62.7
# ::snt No  ,  thanks  .  I'Ve had enough  .  I'll have my bill  ,  please  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 62.8
# ::snt Of course  .  Please wait a moment  .  I'll go and get it  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 62.9
# ::snt Thank you  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 63.0
# ::snt Hi  ,  George  .  I'm going to have a job interview next week  .  Could you give me some advice  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 63.1
# ::snt Sure  .  First of all  ,  it's very important for you not to be late  .  Job interviewers usually don't think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time  ,  only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 63.2
# ::snt Yeah  ,  that's very important  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 63.3
# ::snt So you'd better explore the place the day before and at the same time  ,  look around to see what the employees are wearing  .  So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 63.4
# ::snt I'll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 63.5
# ::snt That's right  .  You need to create a good image in a limited time  ,  usually about 30 to 45 minutes  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 63.6
# ::snt It's always easier to say something than to do it  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 63.7
# ::snt It's not too difficult to make a good impression  .  For example  ,  you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed  .  Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style  .  This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 63.8
# ::snt But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 63.9
# ::snt I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview  .  Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job  ,  or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 63.10
# ::snt It's a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 63.11
# ::snt You misunderstood me  .  Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job  ,  or that you are snobbish or frivolous  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 63.12
# ::snt I know what you mean  .  I ought to wear right clothes at the right time  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 63.13
# ::snt You got it  .  Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 63.14
# ::snt It seems that'clothes make the man' . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 63.15
# ::snt It may not be true  ,  but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 64.0
# ::snt The boss announces the pay raise today  ,  right  ?  How much do you think we'll get  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 64.1
# ::snt No idea  .  Your guess is as good as mine  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 64.2
# ::snt It better be more than last year  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 64.3
# ::snt Well  ,  anything is better than nothing  .  Wait and see  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 65.0
# ::snt I'm sorry  ,  our appointment has to be changed  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 65.1
# ::snt What a pity  ! 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 65.2
# ::snt If you don't mind  ,  may we put it off to the next day  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 65.3

(d / dummy)

# ::id 139.6
# ::snt That's a good idea  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 139.7
# ::snt First  ,  let's read Clause Two about packing  .  It's our usual practice to ship our products in containers  .  That'll save time and money  ,  but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases  .  So  ,  we'd like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 139.8
# ::snt Agreed  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 139.9
# ::snt For shipment  ,  you know we are producing a complete set of equipment for you and it won't all be finished at one time  .  So would you allow us to make partial shipments  .

# ::id 141.4
# ::snt I should not be surprised  ,  many customers have the same opinion  .  Do you have any suggestion in mind  ?  Our salesman told your secretary that the price could be negotiable  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 141.5
# ::snt That's why I came to your office today  .  We think for your model WE - 506  $  590 would be reasonable  ,  because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about 579-649  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 141.6
# ::snt That's true  .  But if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product  ,  you'll agree that 679 is not high  ,  especially when we allow you a 10  %  discount  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 141.7
# ::snt I see your point  .  That's to say s 611 each set  .  Still it's much higher than the market price  .  Could you see your way to reduce the price  ,  Jack  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 141.8
# ::snt Well  ,  considering the quantity of your order we could further reduce the price to 600  .  That's the best we can do  .  What do you think of that  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 141.9
# ::snt All right  .  We accept it  .  So  $  600 for each set  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 141.10

Then there's the CEO — the chief executive officer  .  He's the hot shot  ,  the main guy who is the boss  .  If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization  ,  everyone knows that the power will go to their head  .  It's too dangerous  .  That's the reason for a Board of Directors  .  The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry  .  They could be related to the organization  ,  but more commonly  ,  they are independent and non-biased  .

# ::snt Nothing much  ,  what's going on  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 356.5
# ::snt This Friday  ?  Sorry  ,  I already have plans  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 356.6
# ::snt Doing what  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 356.7
# ::snt I'm going to dinner with my family  .

# ::snt I find that you spend little on handset charge every month  .  Have you any trick  ? 
(d / dummy)

(d / dummy)

# ::id 357.2
# ::snt Is it so simple  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 357.3
# ::snt Sure  .  You know  ,  we spend most of our time at home or in the office every day  ,  so I receive handset calls with the hand-free telephone  ,  so I need pay little for receiving calls  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 357.4
# ::snt It's true  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 357.5
# ::snt Call transfer has many other advantages  .  When I am in places where network can't cover  ,  such as the high building  ,  I also use call transfer function  ,  which transfers my calls to the hand-free telephone and I will not miss any call  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 357.6
# ::snt That's all  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 357.7
# ::snt In hospitals or on planes  ,  handsets will interfere with some equip-ment  ,  so we must close our handsets  .  If you set call transfer  ,  the problem will be solved  .

That's why job interviews are important to let people know the real you that they can't see from a piece of paper  .  But resumes can be helpful in explaining things and giving a good impression to a potential employer  .

# ::snt What was so bad about it  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 503.4
# ::snt Small rooms  ,  small window  ,  a small desk shared by three people  .  I would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 516.8
# ::snt I'm sorry sir but  ,  what exactly did you do  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 516.9
# ::snt Well  ,  I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 516.10
# ::snt Get out of my store  ,  you jerk  ! 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 517.0
# ::snt I have to get to Chicago by tomorrow and you're telling me that there are no flights  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 517.1
# ::snt I'm very sorry  ,  sir  .  I could put you on a waiting list  ,  but you would be wise to check out other means of travel  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 517.2
# ::snt You mean like a bus  ?  Have you ever traveled for ten hours on a bus before  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 517.3
# ::snt I have not sir  .  But I do have a number for a very comfortable bus that goes to Chicago every hour from here  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 517.4
# ::snt Alright  ,  give me the number  .  But put me on that waiting list as well  . 
(d / dummy)

(d / dummy)

# ::id 518.1
# ::snt I don't think that there is any easy way  .  The United Nations could send peacekeepers into the country  .  At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 518.2
# ::snt So  ,  if the cause is poverty  ,  there should be a program to make the country richer . If the problem is resources  ,  share them  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 518.3
# ::snt It sounds easy when you say it like that  .  In reality  ,  it's harder to make peace between countries  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 518.4
# ::snt Yes  ,  it is . One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support  .  Wars are very expensive  . 
(d / dummy)

(d / dummy)

# ::id 521.1
# ::snt I know  .  It really makes a mess of the whole election process  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 521.2
# ::snt And it takes up all the news  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 521.3
# ::snt The problem is that there always a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 521.4
# ::snt It's so small  .  The fact that there is public interest  ,  doesn't say much for us as the public  .

# ::snt I don't remember the last time I listened to AM radio  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 521.7

# ::snt Great  !  Do you think you have a chance at getting the job  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 523.5
# ::snt I didn't just find out about one job  .  There were several ones that looked good  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 523.6
# ::snt Maybe I should try looking on the web for work  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 523.7
# ::snt Sure you have to be patient  .  But I think it's much less trouble to sit in front of a computer than to go door to door or to make a lot of phone calls  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 523.8
# ::snt But there must be so many people who also see the advertisement for that job on the net  .  You might have no chance  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 523.9
# ::snt How do you know if you don't have a try  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 524.0

(d / dummy)

# ::id 528.3
# ::snt That's too bad  .  How much is a new one  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 528.4
# ::snt It's not too much  ,  only about  $  85  .

With the Deposit  ,  the interest is fixed  ,  but the Dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year  .

(d / dummy)

# ::id 547.13
# ::snt Please  ,  Mummy  .  I found it this afternoon by the garbage bin  .  It was starving and looking for something to eat  .  Please  !  You see  ,  it's so cute and tame  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 547.14
# ::snt All right  .  But you have to clean up everything it messes up  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 547.15
# ::snt I will  .  Thank you  ,  Mummy  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 548.0
# ::snt I was wondering if you could help me with something  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 548.1
# ::snt Sure  ,  anything you say  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 549.1
# ::snt It has been 12 years since it was founded in 1998  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 549.2
# ::snt So  ,  it has a history for more than a decade  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 549.3
# ::snt Yes  .  And it was incorporated with other businesses in 2008 due to the global financial crisis  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 550.0
# ::snt What can I do for you  ,  Madam  ? 
(d / dummy)

(d / dummy)

# ::id 550.3
# ::snt Well  ,  everything really  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 550.4
# ::snt All right  .  We can grant a Financing Promise Quota  ,  if you qualify  .  This means that we can deal with all of your needs in a speedy and efficient way  .  Firstly  ,  your Credit Rating must be class A  ,  and your Debt to Asset Ratio must be top notch  ,  for the industry you are involved in  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 551.0
# ::snt Let's do something outdoors today  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 551.1
# ::snt All right  .  But I don't want to play tennis  .  We played tennis last weekend  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 551.2
# ::snt Okay  .  what do you want to do  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 551.3
# ::snt I want to go jogging  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 551.4
# ::snt All right  .  That sounds like fun  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 552.0
# ::snt Good afternoon  .  I come here specially to pick up my tickets  .  I booked it last month . This is my reservation note  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 552.1
# ::snt I am terribly sorry  .  You didn't come to reconfirm recently . You should have come to pick up your ticket three days ago since it's an international flight  ,  any reservation without reconfirmation within 72 hours will be cancelled  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 552.2
# ::snt But I have been so busy all these days . Well  ,  is there any other ticket available  ?  I want the next one  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 553.0
# ::snt The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 553.1
# ::snt Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much  ?  The same is true in the West  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 553.2
# ::snt No  ,  absolutely not  !  On the contrary  ,  you'll be considered a well-connected  ,  sociable man  ,  if you keep involved in the conversation all the time  .  But always pay attention to what you say  .  If the table has a senior guest  ,  say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible  .  Or maybe  ,  you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 553.3
# ::snt You mean  ,  keeping a low profile in the presence of the old  ?  That goes in like with Confucius'preachings  ,  right  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 553.4
# ::snt Correct  .  Show respect for the older people  .  Conventionally  ,  before the meal starts  ,  the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one  .  Others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite  .  Toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 553.5
# ::snt Any other rules to observe in order to keep modest  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 553.6
# ::snt Yes  ,  plenty of them  .  Don't eat fast  !  People usually keep their dining pace accorded with others  .  And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 553.7
# ::snt Is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 553.8
# ::snt Haha  ,  I'm afraid it's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 554.0
# ::snt Our toner cartridges are already out of ink  .  .  .  Could you make an order for a new set  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 554.1
# ::snt We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers  ?  That will be a large order  ,  probably about two or three cases  .  The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 554.2
# ::snt You can double check with the housekeeping department  ,  but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges  .  Last time when we made our order to the supplier  ,  the quantity was also especially high  .  They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us  .  As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance  ,  they can usually fill the order  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 554.3
# ::snt OK  ,  I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure  .  Is there anything else we need to order while I am at it  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 554.4
# ::snt I think the only thing is toner  .  Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow  .  We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis  .  Anyhow  ,  see what you can do to expedite the order this time  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 554.5
# ::snt OK  ,  will do  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 555.0
# ::snt I want a pair of sports shoes  ,  Adidas  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 555.1
# ::snt What size do you want  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 555.2
# ::snt I wear size 40  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 555.3
# ::snt How about this one  ?  It's the latest design  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 555.4
# ::snt Oh  ,  I like the color  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 556.0
# ::snt May I help you  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 556.1
# ::snt I'm looking for a pair of shoes  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 556.2
# ::snt What size do you wear  ?  These shoes are on sale  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 556.3
# ::snt I wear size 36 . This pair looks nice . Can I try them on  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 556.4
# ::snt Of course  ,  yes . They look nice . And they're not expensive  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 556.5
# ::snt How much are they  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 556.6
# ::snt They are  $  168  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 556.7
# ::snt I'll take them  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 557.0
# ::snt A friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days  .  He told me the other day he has learned a lot from it  .  He recommended me to subscribe to it  .  What do you say  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 557.1
# ::snt I think it is good if we know enough about career planning  .  We will make wiser choices  .  What else did he tell you about it  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 557.2
# ::snt Well  ,  just something in general  ,  like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 557.3
# ::snt Sounds practical  !  To be honest  ,  sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career  .  I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker  .  I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 557.4
# ::snt Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do  .  It seems that you need this course more than I do  .  I love my current job  .  If I take this course  ,  I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work  .  If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships  ,  that will be great  .  I need these to improve my current work performance  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 557.5
# ::snt Ok  ,  then we can sign up for it together  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 558.0
# ::snt Who's it knocking at the door  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 558.1
# ::snt I think it's the postman . Will you go and open the door  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 558.2
# ::snt All right  .  I'll get it  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 559.0
# ::snt Good evening  .  Welcome to Cherry's  .  Do you have a reservation  ?

# ::id 559.1
# ::snt No  ,  we don't  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 559.2
# ::snt How many of you  ,  please  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 559.3
# ::snt Six  ,  including two kids  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 559.4
# ::snt I'm afraid all the big tables are taken  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 560.0
# ::snt Hi  ,  I think I was supposed to call for my test results today  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 560.1
# ::snt If you go onto our website and put in your password  ,  you can access your test results  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 560.2
# ::snt Are you saying that there weren't any problems  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 560.3
# ::snt I will always have you come in for a discussion if there is a major problem  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 560.4
# ::snt Will I be able to read the results on the website and understand them  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 560.5
# ::snt Yes  ,  if you go there  ,  you can see what each test is about  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 560.6
# ::snt How will I know what the numbers mean  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 560.7
# ::snt You can see your results and how they compare to the normal range  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 560.8
# ::snt How can I see test results from tests I have taken before  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 560.9
# ::snt We put all of your test results up in the same place  .  Just check the dates for what you need  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 561.0
# ::snt This is our rock-bottom price  ,  Mr  .  Lee  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 561.1
# ::snt If that's the case  .  there's not much point in further discussion  .  We might as well call the whole deal off  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 561.2
# ::snt What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price  .  The gap is too great  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 561.3
# ::snt I think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible  .  How about meeting each other halfway  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 561.4
# ::snt What's your proposal  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 561.5
# ::snt Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we want  .  Well  ,  I suggest we meet each other halfway  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 561.6
# ::snt Do you mean a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price  ?  That's impossible  ! 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 561.7
# ::snt What would you suggest  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 561.8
# ::snt The best we can do is another 30 dollars off  .  That's definitely the lowest we can go  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 561.9
# ::snt That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars  .  Let's meet each other half-away again and split the difference  ;  I think this is a price we can both be satisfied with  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 561.10
# ::snt OK  .  We can meet halfway again  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 562.0
# ::snt Hello  .

# ::id 563.1
# ::snt Yes  ,  we have  .  We've had to clean up our production process a lot to meet tough government standards  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 563.2
# ::snt What about your use of raw materials  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 563.3
# ::snt Well  ,  we've had to cut down the amount of solvents we use and we're not allowed to use lead in our products any more  .

(d / dummy)

# ::id 566.3

(d / dummy)

# ::id 567.0
# ::snt I don't want you to be worried  ,  but our son has some bad habits now  .  He says painful words everyday  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 567.1
# ::snt What words  ?  Can you tell me  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 567.2
# ::snt He says kick mommy  ,  beat mommy  ,  don't want mommy  ,  very quickly if I do something that he doesn't like  .  You know  ,  if I wash his face or change his clothes  ,  things like that  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 567.3
# ::snt Honey  ,  I don't know what to tell you  .  Of course Tony is a young child  .  But do not underestimate his ability to learn and reason  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 567.4
# ::snt Yes  ,  but sometimes he is just not reasonable  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 567.5

(d / dummy)

(d / dummy)

(d / dummy)

# ::id 712.3
# ::snt I agree  .  Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business  .  It won't take much time to design an amazing card  ,  but it can make a big difference among the crowd  .  And you'll always notice it from your collection  .  For they have outspoken colors  ,  own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card  .  I wish to have one like this  .  But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow  .

(d / dummy)

# ::id 714.1

(d / dummy)

# ::id 714.2
# ::snt Well  ,  at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon  .  This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth  .  In any case  ,  to take better advantage of the daylight available  ,  we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour  .

(d / dummy)

# ::id 714.5
# ::snt That's why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA  !  Because of the huge time difference  ,  even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours  ,  we still arrived in LA the same day at noon  !  It's like we went back in time  !

(d / dummy)

# ::id 716.3

(d / dummy)

# ::id 749.5
# ::snt Well  ,  last week I invited her over to dinner  .  My husband and I had no problem with the food  ,  but if you listened to her  ,  then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables  .  There's just nothing can please her  .

(d / dummy)

# ::snt That's true  .  Some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones  . 
(d / dummy)

(d / dummy)

# ::id 823.2
# ::snt But I'm not used to looking up every new word when I'm reading a novel  .  I only look up the most necessary ones  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 824.0
# ::snt Don't you agree that all the thieves should be punished by cutting off their fingers  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 824.1
# ::snt I'm afraid many people would turn thumbs down on it  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 824.2
# ::snt Don't you think in that case  ,  there wouldn't be so much stealing  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 824.3
# ::snt Definitely  .  But I think it is too fierce  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 825.0
# ::snt The bartender just gave the last call  .  Let's order another round  ,  okay  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 825.1
# ::snt Sure  ,  but let's get a pitcher this time We should be able to down it before they close  .

(d / dummy)

# ::id 833.7
# ::snt I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them  ,  like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities  .  Our boss is a smart person  .  He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team  .

# ::snt You are right  .  But I just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::snt They are  .  The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 847.8
# ::snt That's so disappointing  .  I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::snt I don't think it's right  ,  but I can understand why they might  .  Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country  !

(d / dummy)

(d / dummy)

# ::id 853.4
# ::snt What do you think our chance are in other events  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 853.5

(d / dummy)

# ::id 895.2
# ::snt That's exactly what I am going to do  !  I'Ve decided to create my own company  !  I'm going to write up a business plan  ,  get some investors and start working for myself  ! 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 895.3
# ::snt Have you ever written up a business plan before  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 895.4
# ::snt Well  ,  no  ,  it can't be that hard  !  I mean  ,  all you have to do is explain your business  ,  how you are going to do things and that's it  ,  right  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 895.5
# ::snt You couldn't be more wrong  !  A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less  .  Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has  ,  history  ,  etc  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 895.6
# ::snt Well  ,  that seems easy enough  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 895.7
# ::snt Wait  ,  there's more  !  Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services  .  What they are and how they are different from competitors' ?  Then comes the hard part  ,  a market analysis  .  You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables  !  You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has  !  All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage  ,  where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 895.8
# ::snt Geez  .  Is that all  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 895.9
# ::snt Almost  ,  the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis  .  Here you will calculate and estimate sales  ,  cash flow and profits  .  After all  ,  people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment  ! 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 895.10
# ::snt Umm  .  I think I'll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business  ! 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 897.4
# ::snt Ok  .  Maybe you should invite your sister along  ,  too  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::snt Not much  ,  that new reality-TV show  ,  Ally McNeal  ,  oooo  ,  Dark Angel  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 898.2
# ::snt Wait a second  .  I want to watch Ally McNeal  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 898.3
# ::snt Oh  ,  come on  .  That's such a girl's show  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 898.4
# ::snt No it's not  .  It's just funny  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 898.5
# ::snt Yeah  ,  if you're a girl  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 898.6
# ::snt Well  ,  you just want to watch Dark Angel because of the hot girl  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 898.7
# ::snt That's not true  .  Dark Angel is a good show  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 898.8
# ::snt It's story is just an excuse to get the girl dressed up in different tight outfits  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 898.9
# ::snt O  .  K  .   ,  O  .  K  .  Let's forget it  .  There's a football game on too  .

(d / dummy)

# ::id 899.0
# ::snt It's really terrible  ! 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 899.1
# ::snt What are you talking about  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 899.2
# ::snt Don't you see many parents are forcing there children's hands to learn something they think important to their children  .  But the children are not interested in it at all  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 899.3
# ::snt You said it  .  Many parents just don't know how to educate their children  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 900.0
# ::snt Sarah  ,  what did you do today  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 900.1
# ::snt I went shopping  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::snt Did you buy anything  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 900.3
# ::snt Yes  ,  I bought a few things  . 
(d / dummy)

(d / dummy)

(d / dummy)

# ::snt I know  .  It was a really good deal  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 900.12
# ::snt I don't think you'll need to wear it for a while  .  It's been really hot lately  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 901.0
# ::snt Hi  ,  Victor  .  How are you  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 901.1
# ::snt Oh  ,  I'm fine  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 901.2
# ::snt So  ,  are you going to go to class tonight  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 901.3
# ::snt Maybe  .  .  .  but I don't think so  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 901.4
# ::snt Really  ?  What's the matter  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 901.5
# ::snt I don't know  .  I'm just feeling a little sad  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 901.6
# ::snt Listen  .  Come with me to class  ,  and after class we can go out for dinner  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 901.7
# ::snt Now that's a good idea  .  Thanks a lot  ,  Brian  .  I'm feeling better already  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 902.0

# ::snt He can barely make ends meet  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 903.0

(d / dummy)

# ::id 903.1
# ::snt They're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 903.2
# ::snt If the Phoenix beats the Rocket  ,  it will enter the final  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 903.3
# ::snt No way  ,  if it still has 21  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 904.0
# ::snt What's that book you have under your arm  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 904.1
# ::snt It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 904.2
# ::snt How in the world did you get a copy  ?  I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 904.3
# ::snt I checked it out of the rental library  .  It only costs five cents a day  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 904.4
# ::snt Is it really worth paying for  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 904.5
# ::snt I can't tell yet  .  I haven't got beyond the first chapter  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 904.6
# ::snt If it's any good  ,  I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 905.0
# ::snt Come on  ,  you are left behind  ! 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 905.1
# ::snt Wow  ,  I can't catch my breath  .  You are running too fast  ,  honey  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 905.2
# ::snt You just need more exercise  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 905.3
# ::snt Yes  ,  but you need to slow down  .  This is jogging  ,  not racing  ! 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 905.4
# ::snt I don't care  .  I want to burn up my fat  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 905.5
# ::snt But running so fast is not good for people over forties  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 905.6
# ::snt Why  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 905.7
# ::snt We are not as athletic as we were when young  .  Mild exercise is more suitable for us  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 905.8
# ::snt But I want to burn up more calories  ! 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 905.9
# ::snt In fact  ,  in order to burn up your fat  ,  you must take it slowly for a longer time  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 905.10
# ::snt Really  ?  I will slow down then  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 906.0
# ::snt Hello  ,  Daisy  ,  how are you doing  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 906.1
# ::snt Fine  ,  thank you  .  I haven't seen you for quite some time  .  What have you been up to recently  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 906.2
# ::snt I have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home  ,  so you wouldn't have seen me  .  Recently  ,  I've been obsessed with horror films  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 906.3
# ::snt Oh  ,  how can you be infatuated with horror films  ?  They're so scary  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 906.4
# ::snt Yeah  ,  you are right I used to not watch horror films  ,  but after seeing Silence of the Lamb with Mike last month  ,  I fell in love with them  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 906.5
# ::snt It's amazing  .  But if I were you  ,  I wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 906.6
# ::snt But it's really exciting  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 906.7
# ::snt Maybe  ,  but I would rather watch romance  ,  science fiction  ,  crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture  .  I wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 906.8
# ::snt Basically  .  you'll watch any type of movie except horror  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 906.9
# ::snt Yep  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 906.10
# ::snt I think you should have a try someday  .  Maybe you'll change your mind  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 906.11
# ::snt Maybe  .  After all  ,  I am grown up now  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 907.0
# ::snt It's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed  .  .  .  The trade deficit is getting larger  ,  consumption's down  ,  I really think we're headed for a recession  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 907.1
# ::snt The economy has been stagnant for a while now  .  We've been in a recessive state for several months already  .  What worries me the most is the trade deficit  .  I think the government should do more to encourage exports  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 907.2
# ::snt Increasing exports would weaken the currency  .  I think the main point is economic growth  .  We need more jobs  .  Factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries  .  The result is an increase in unemployment in our own country  ,  lower consumption  ,  lower production  ,  and an overall feeble economy  .  If more people are working  ,  it will give the economy a boost  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 907.3
# ::snt It's true that we should do something about unemployment  ,  but what about inflation  ?  If unemployment falls  ,  there's pressure to increase pay  .  That would result in inflation  ,  which would result in a much less dynamic economy  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 908.0
# ::snt Are you an art aficionado  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 908.1
# ::snt Not really  .  I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year  .  I hardly know anything about art or sculpture  .  You are a true art lover  ,  aren't you  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 908.2
# ::snt I love going to art galleries  ,  particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 908.3
# ::snt I never understand the meaning of those painting  .  They are too abstract for me  .  I didn't pay much attention in art class at school  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 908.4
# ::snt Art isn't for everyone  .  I'm going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery  .  It's an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 908.5
# ::snt I like sculpture  ,  especially that from ancient rome or Greece  .  What time are you thinking of going  ?  I'd love to go with you  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 908.6
# ::snt I thought I'd have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards  .  Does that sound ok to you  ?  Bus 51 goes directly there  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 908.7
# ::snt That sounds fine  .  What time shall we meet at the bus stop  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 908.8
# ::snt Let's meet at 12 thirty  .  it will probably take us three or four hours to see all of the exhibits  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 909.0

(d / dummy)

# ::id 909.1

(d / dummy)

# ::id 910.3
# ::snt I'd like to offer you my congratulations on your birthday and best wishes for your future happiness  ,  good health and continued success  .  I've asked the Fairy Flowers to send you a bunch of flowers  .  I hope you'll like them  .

(d / dummy)

# ::id 912.5
# ::snt Turn on the TV for what  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 912.6
# ::snt So that we can sit down together and listen to some music  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 912.7
# ::snt Listen to the music  ?  And who will cook dinner  ,  will you  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 912.8
# ::snt I will  ,  but let's go to the disco after dinner  .

Always make sure there isn't anything in the chamber  ,  and never put your finger on the trigger unless you are ready to shoot  !

(d / dummy)

# ::id 970.10
# ::snt I should have known it was you  .  No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly  .  I thought I might have found the one for me  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 970.11
# ::snt I'm sorry  .  It was cruel of me  .  But I promise it will never happen again  ?  Look  ,  there's a nice restaurant  .  Let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 971.0
# ::snt Peter  ,  how often do you exercise  ?

(d / dummy)

# ::id 973.2
# ::snt Maybe that's true for some positions  ,  but I think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree  .  They dress for success  !  You can't go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans  .  It's just not respectful to you client  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 973.3
# ::snt I think what you wear is so overrated  .  I would rather have a down-to-earth  ,  honest and solid sales person than a painted  ,  patent leather  ,  designer suite salesman  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 973.4
# ::snt It's not as simple as that  .  People judge you by your appearance  ,  whether you like it or not  .  So dressing professional is being professional  .  The image that you portray to others is so important in business  .  It's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale  .

(d / dummy)

# ::id 974.5
# ::snt You're right  ,  but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 974.6
# ::snt What other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 974.7
# ::snt Quite a number  .  Actually every skyscraper has a history  .  A few blocks ahead we'll see St . Patrick's Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center  .  It's a landmark in the history of architecture  .

(d / dummy)

# ::id 975.2
# ::snt What did she tell them  ?  Is she dropping out of college  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 975.3
# ::snt Nothing that serious  .  She finally told them that she moved out of the dormitory a few months ago and has been living with her boyfriend  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 975.4
# ::snt And your parents took it badly  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 975.5
# ::snt That's putting it mildly  .  My father started shouting at my sister and my mother just glared at her  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 975.6
# ::snt Ouch  ,  that sounds bad  .  What did your sister do  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 975.7

(d / dummy)

# ::id 975.11
# ::snt What do you mean  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 975.12
# ::snt Well  ,  these days too many people are getting divorced  .  If they live together  ,  then at least they're finding out if they're really compatible or not  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 975.13
# ::snt I guess so  .  Better to find out now than after you're married  ,  when it's harder to get out  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 976.0
# ::snt Do you think they two will get married  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 976.1
# ::snt Yeah  ,  you can count on it  . 
(d / dummy)

(d / dummy)

# ::id 977.3
# ::snt Whatever things get tough  ,  he gives in  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::snt I sure hope so  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 979.0
# ::snt Do you speak only English in the class  ,  or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 979.1
# ::snt Oh  ,  we never speak Spanish in class  !  Miss . Parker speaks to us only in English  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 979.2
# ::snt I suppose she's right  .  Does she speak English very slowly  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 979.3
# ::snt Not always  .  Sometimes we don't understand her  .  Then she has to repeat what she said  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 979.4
# ::snt It must be interesting to study English  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 979.5
# ::snt Mario and I are the best students in the class  .  Miss . Parker says that my pronunciation is very good  .

(d / dummy)

# ::id 984.12
# ::snt you said it  .  I think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 984.13
# ::snt how  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 984.14
# ::snt for a start  ,  we can take the public transport to work  .  You know  ,  running a car is a big expense  .
