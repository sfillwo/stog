(d / dummy)

# ::id 1
# ::snt You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 2
# ::snt What do you mean  ?  It will help us to relax  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 3
# ::snt Do you really think so  ?  I don't  .  It will just make us fat and act silly  .  Remember last time  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 4
# ::snt I guess you are right . But what shall we do  ?  I don't feel like sitting at home  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 5
# ::snt I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 6
# ::snt That's a good idea  .  I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play pingpong . Perhaps we can make a foursome with them  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 7
# ::snt Sounds great to me  !  If they are willing  ,  we could ask them to go dancing with us . That is excellent exercise and fun  ,  too  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 8
# ::snt Good . Let's go now  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 9

(d / dummy)

(d / dummy)

# ::id 14
# ::snt Of course I can  .  It's a piece of cake  !  Believe it or not  ,  I can do 30 push-ups a minute  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 15
# ::snt Really  ?  I think that's impossible  ! 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 16
# ::snt You mean 30 push-ups  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 17
# ::snt Yeah  ! 
(d / dummy)

# ::snt It's easy  .  If you do exercise everyday  ,  you can make it  ,  too  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 22
# ::snt Can you study with the radio on  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 23
# ::snt No  ,  I listen to background music  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 24
# ::snt What is the difference  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 25
# ::snt The radio has too many comerials  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 26
# ::snt That's true  ,  but then you have to buy a record player  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 30
# ::snt Are you all right  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 31
# ::snt I will be all right soon  .  I was terrified when I watched them fall from the wire  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 32
# ::snt Don't worry . He is an acrobat ã€‚
(d / dummy)

# ::id 33

(d / dummy)

# ::id 39
# ::snt What position do you play  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 40
# ::snt I'm a defender  .  It's a lot of fun  .  You don't have to be able to skate as fast on defense  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 41
# ::snt Yeah  ,  you're a pretty big guy  .  I play goalie  ,  myself  . 
(d / dummy)

(d / dummy)

# ::id 50
# ::snt I'm looking at my horoscope for this month  !  My outlook is very positive  .  It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic  ,  and that I will have a passionate summer fling  ! 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 51
# ::snt What are you talking about  ?  Let me see that  .  .  .  What are horoscopes  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 52
# ::snt It's a prediction of your month  ,  based on your zodiac sign  .  You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in  .  I was born on April 15th  ,  so I'm an Aries  .  When were you born  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 53
# ::snt January 5th  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 54
# ::snt Let's see  .   .   .  you're a Capricorn  .  It says that you will be feeling stress at work  ,  but you could see new  ,  exciting developments in your love life  .  Looks like we'll both have interesting summers  ! 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 55
# ::snt That's bogus  .  I don't feel any stress at work  ,  and my love life is practically nonexistent  .  This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 56
# ::snt No  ,  it's not  ,  your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality  .  See  ?  It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 57
# ::snt Well  ,  you certainly match those criteria  ,  but they're so broad they could apply to anyone  .  What does it say about me  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 58
# ::snt A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical  .  She likes to do things in conventional ways  .  That sounds just like you  ! 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 62

(d / dummy)

# ::id 66
# ::snt A girl he met on holiday in Spain  ,  I think  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 67
# ::snt Have they set a date for the wedding  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 68
# ::snt Not yet  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 72
# ::snt I hear you bought a new house in the northern suburbs  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 73
# ::snt That's right  ,  we bought it the same day we came on the market  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 74
# ::snt What kind of house is it  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 75
# ::snt It's a wonderful Spanish style  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 76
# ::snt Oh  ,  I love the roof tiles on Spanish style houses  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 77
# ::snt And it's a bargaining  .  A house like this in river side costs double the price  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 78
# ::snt Great  ,  is it a two bedroom house  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 79
# ::snt No  ,  it has three bedrooms and three beds  ,  and has a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling  .  There's a two-car garage  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 80
# ::snt That's a nice area too  .  It'll be a good investment for you  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 81
# ::snt Yeas  ,  when will you buy a house  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 82
# ::snt Not untill the end of this year  ,  you know  ,  just before my wedding  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 83
# ::snt Right  ,  congratulations  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 84
# ::snt Thank you  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 88
# ::snt Hi  ,  Becky  ,  what's up  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 89
# ::snt Not much  ,  except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 90
# ::snt What's the problem  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 91
# ::snt She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do  .  I can never do anything right when she's around  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 92
# ::snt For example  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 93
# ::snt Well  ,  last week I invited her over to dinner  .  My husband and I had no problem with the food  ,  but if you listened to her  ,  then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables  .  There's just nothing can please her  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 94
# ::snt No  ,  I can't see that happening  .  I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 95
# ::snt It's not just that  .  She also criticizes how we raise the kids  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 96
# ::snt My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us  .  If it wasn't disciplining them enough  ,  then we were disciplining them too much  .  She also complained about the food we fed them  ,  the schools we sent them too  ,  and everything else under the sun  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 97
# ::snt You said she used to  ?  How did you stop her  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 98
# ::snt We basically sat her down and told her how we felt about her constant criticizing  ,  and how we welcomed her advice but hoped she'd let us do our things  .  She understood  ,  and now everything is a lot more peaceful  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 99
# ::snt That sounds like a good idea  .  I'll have to try that  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 103
# ::snt How are Zina's new programmers working out  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 104
# ::snt I hate to admit it  ,  but they're good  .  And fast  .  The Filipino kid is a genius  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 105
# ::snt So you'll make the Stars . com deadline  ,  and have us up and running next week  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 106
# ::snt It'll be close  ,  but we'll make it  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 107
# ::snt Good  .  After Stars . com starts paying us  ,  we won't need Vikam's cash anymore  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 108
# ::snt And if we don't need them  ,  we won't need Zina  ,  either  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 112
# ::snt Do you like cooking  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 113
# ::snt Yes  .  I like cooking very much  .  I got this hobby when I was 12 years sold  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 114
# ::snt Why do you like it  ? 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 115
# ::snt I have no idea  .  I like cooking by myself  .  I like to taste delicious food  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 116
# ::snt That's wonderful  ! 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 117
# ::snt And I love trying new recipes  ,  which I usually test with my friends  .  You can come  ,  too  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 118
# ::snt Really  ?  I hope I can have a chance to taste it  .  Don't forget to tell me  .

(d / dummy)

# ::id 127
# ::snt You look like a cooking show host--only messier  . 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 131
# ::snt You look so tan and healthy  ! 
(d / dummy)

# ::id 132
# ::snt Thanks  .  I just got back from summer camp  .
